I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means _anything_ - Personal questions. Making and spending money. Work. Life. Coding. Workflow. Setups.

I'm an independent fullstack developer primarily writing JavaScript. I teach, speak and write all things code. 

I'm [@WesBos](http://WesBos.com) on twitter, I blog at [wesbos.com](http://wesbos.com).
